Aim: to create a CRUD application with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.
This project aims to showcase content learned in training, specifically in:
⦁	Project Management - Jira Kanban Board and Version Control System (Git)
⦁	Databases 
⦁	JAVA - OOP language used for the backend
⦁	Spring Boot
⦁	HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - languages used for frontend
⦁	Testing - Junit and Mockito for unit testing, and MockMVC for integration testing

Project Management: Kanban Board - created using Jira Software
 
FE: https://demo-af.atlassian.net/browse/WP-1
BE: https://demo-af.atlassian.net/browse/WP-2
Documentation: https://demo-af.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/WP/boards/3

Databases - this project has used two databases: 

1. H2 for testing , using  a data.sql and a schema.sql file used to pre populate the fields. H2 is a local database that does not persist data, and so is convenient for testing back end functionality . 
2. mySQL - a persistant relational database used for the production of the application
Backend
The backend functionality of the project is written in Java using Spring Boot Framework, which allows convenient conneciton between the front end, back end and the database.
Front end
The frontend functionality is written in HTML, JavaScript and uses the Bootstrap framework to create the layout and therefore a more pleasing experience for the user
Testing
The backend functionality was tested using both unit testing and integrated testing
Unit testing - JUnit and Mockito 
Integrated Testing - MockMVC

Improvements
- Functionality improvement of data entry for field Day of Week, as this could be coded as an Enum with a drop down menu restricting data entry to only days of the week.
- Integrating the 'update workout' form into the 'create workout form' using a button 'edit' rather than using a separate form to replace a workout.
- Front end fine tuning utilising CSS and Bootstrap to its full potential to create a more aesthetically pleasing web page.
